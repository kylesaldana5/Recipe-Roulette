# Cooking Game Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- To enable users to effortlessly discover personalized recipes based on their available ingredients.
- To transform everyday cooking into an engaging and rewarding game through unique challenges.
- To provide clear progression and a sense of achievement for home cooks engaging in culinary exploration.

### Background Context

The modern home cook is increasingly seeking culinary adventure and efficiency, yet often finds themselves stuck in a cycle of repetitive meals or overwhelmed by the sheer volume of generic online recipes. This "recipe paralysis" stifles creativity and can lead to underutilized ingredients and food waste. While numerous cooking applications exist, they typically function as static digital cookbooks or basic search engines, failing to provide an engaging, progressive, or truly personalized experience that motivates continued exploration. This project emerges from a desire to address the gap in the market for a gamified cooking platform that not only solves the immediate problem of "what to cook" based on available ingredients but also fosters a deeper, more enjoyable, and skill-building culinary journey.

- 2: Core build tools (e.g., Webpack/Vite for frontend, Babel/TypeScript for backend) are configured.
- 3: A PostgreSQL database instance is set up and accessible by the backend.
- 4: Basic database migration tools are configured and a simple initial migration is runnable.
- 5: Authentication scaffolding (e.g., user registration/login endpoints) is in place, even if not fully integrated into UI.
- 6: An initial health-check endpoint is available for both frontend and backend.

### Story 1.2 Ingredient Input and Storage

As a **user**,
I want to **be able to input a list of ingredients I have**,
so that **the system knows what I have available.**

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: A dedicated UI screen or component allows users to type in ingredients or select from a predefined list.
- 2: Entered ingredients are stored in the user's session or profile.
- 3: Ingredient matching is case-insensitive and can handle singular/plural forms (e.g., "apple" matches "apples").
- 4: The system provides immediate visual feedback (e.g., list updates) as ingredients are added/removed.

### Story 1.3 Random Recipe Suggestion Engine

As a **user**,
I want to **receive a random recipe suggestion based on my available ingredients**,
so that **I can quickly decide what to cook.**

#### Acceptance Criteria

- 1: Upon submission of available ingredients, the system selects one recipe from its database.
- 2: The selected recipe must be completable with the user's provided ingredients (or clearly indicate missing optional ingredients).
